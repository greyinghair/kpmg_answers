# Q3
# Create a function that takes a file name and word. Search the file to find all lines that start with the given word. Test your function using the file 'austen.txt' and find all lines that begin with "Mr". Hint: is a function that returns True/False if a string ends with a value...maybe there is one that checks to see if a string "starts with"?
