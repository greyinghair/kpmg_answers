## Q2
# Create a Circle class, initialise it with a radius.
# Create two methods for the Circle class: get_area() and get_circumference() which give both respective areas
# and circumference, to 2 decimal places.

# Note: Area of a circle = πr ** 2
# Circumference = 2πr
# Use the round() function to get the answer to 2 decimal places
