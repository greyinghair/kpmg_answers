## Q3
# Create a Employee class and initialise it with name and staff number.
# i. Make methods to:
    # display_info - It should display all the information of the employee.
    # set_department - It should assign the department to employee.
    # set_bonus - It should assign a bonus amount to the employee.

# ii. Create the instance attributes first name and last name instead of name.
    # Create two methods full_name and email_address in the Employee class.
    # Given a person's first and last names:
    # Form the full_name method by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a space.
    # Form the email_address by joining the first and last name together
        # with a . in between, and follow it with @company.com at the end. Make sure everything is in lowercase.

class Employee:

    def __init__(self, fname, lname, number):
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
        self.number = number
        self.fullname = fname + " " + lname # create fullname from joining first and last names
