## Casting will define a datatype, including converting such as changing a Float to an Integer
#
x=int (5.6) # change float of 5.6 to integer of 5
y=float ("7.3") # string of 7.3 into float of 7.3
z=str(9) # integer of 9 into string of '9'
z2=str(10.0) # float into a string

print(x) # should print 5
