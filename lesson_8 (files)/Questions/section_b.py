# For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected
# probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as
# real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data.
# Work out which of the files contains fake data.

# Fake data likely close in values of use to those created by randomly generated baseline
