## Numerical Operators
# +
# -
# *
# /
# ** which is to the power open
# % which is remainder of ie 10 % 3 is 1 left over after the division

## Numerical Order of Operations
# Highest   ()    Brackets
#           **    Exponent
#           *     Multiplication
#           /     Division
#           +     Addition
# Lowest    -     Subtraction

a = 1.0
b = 2.0
print (a / b)

# Include calc of variable in anopther variable
x = 3
y = 6
area = x * y
print (area)

## Testing Section B
# Print 2 + 2
print (2 + 2)
# Print 5.7 substracted from 3.4
print (3.4 - 5.7) 
# Print 8 * 7
print (8 * 7)
# Print 144 / 12
print (144 / 12)
# Print remainder if 67 divided by 12
print (67 % 12)
# Print value of 20 from '4-2*6/3*5'
print ((4-2)*6/3*5)
